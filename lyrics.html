        I'm in the <mark style="background-color: red;">thick</mark> of it, everybody knows
        They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
        I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
        Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told

        I'm in my prime and this ain't even final form
        They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor
        I went from living rooms straight out to sold-out tours
        Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war

        Woah-oh-oh
        This is how the story goes
        Woah-oh-oh
        I guess this is how the story goes

        I'm in the <mark style="background-color: red;">thick</mark> of it, everybody knows
        They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
        I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
        Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told

        <b>From the screen to the ring, to the pen, to the king</b>
        Where's my crown? That's my bling
        Always drama when I ring
        See, I believe that if I see it in my heart
        Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reachin' for the stars

        Woah-oh-oh
        This is how the story goes
        Woah-oh-oh
        I guess this is how the story goes

        I'm in the <mark style="background-color: red;">thick</mark> of it, everybody knows
        They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze (woo)
        I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
        Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told

        Highway to heaven, I'm just cruisin' by my lone'
        They cast me out, left me for dead, them people cold
        My faith in God, mind in the sun, I'm 'bout to sow (yeah)
        My life is hard, I took the wheel, I cracked the code (yeah-yeah, woah-oh-oh)
        Ain't nobody gon' save you, man, this life will break you (yeah, woah-oh-oh)
        In the thick of it, this is how the story goes

        I'm in the <mark style="background-color: red;">thick</mark> of it, everybody knows

        Woah-oh-oh (nah-nah-nah-nah, ayy, ayy)
        This is how the story goes (nah, nah)
        Woah-oh-oh
